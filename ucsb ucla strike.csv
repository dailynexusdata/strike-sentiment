UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/11/22,The strike hasn't happened yet
UCSB,JockeyAnonðŸŽ„#6643,11/11/22,last year when they had the faculty strike
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/11/22,It was an authorized strike but idt it ever became approved
UCSB,Museblood#6969,11/13/22,guys my ochem lab ta is still holding lab... and hes an international student :NWcrying: and katherine just informed me that him not participating in the strike could leave him open to retaliation from ucsb and not getting the protections the unions are bargaining for
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/13/22,im in a union :3
UCSB,Museblood#6969,11/13/22,im gonna request access to the union faq google sheet and grief

UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/13/22,striking but not in solidarity i guess
UCSB,Museblood#6969,11/13/22,FUCK OUR GRADES BE SAFE BIG DAWG
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/13/22,Because he's not protected by the union or the UC for being in between
UCSB,eVoked#7790,11/13/22,i didnt even know there a strike going on
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/13/22,Yeah but we're a day before the strike
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/13/22,Without the strike
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/13/22,So kinda late for bargaining
UCSB,haze#0266,11/13/22,solidarity
UCSB,brandon_#7943,11/13/22,Got the email from two classes about no sections
UCSB,Museblood#6969,11/14/22,they deployed skyco to break the strike
UCSB,Skyco#5004,11/14/22,I be debating the grad students and shit
UCSB,eVoked#7790,11/14/22,Damn maybe if I paid more attention to the strikes I woulda known class was canceled
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/14/22,Strike disrupting
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/14/22,Econ def got Union busting 101
UCSB,RJ#0601,11/14/22,FUCK UNIONS
UCSB,SCB#0078,11/14/22,how tf strikes make your midterm in person LMAOO
UCSB,RJ#0601,11/14/22,But bc all the fuckwad TA's are going on strike there's no one to grade them all
UCSB,JockeyAnonðŸŽ„#6643,11/14/22,honestly even if i was making a comfortable amount of money as a ta(which is improbable) id still go to the strike bc of the workers rights being revoked if you dont participate
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/14/22,*if youre part of the union
UCSB,Decadakon#1432,11/14/22,wasn't it winter 2020 when the TAs last striked
UCSB,JockeyAnonðŸŽ„#6643,11/14/22,like screeching everything to a halt at 2 weeks from finals so everyone complains to the UC and they cave in
UCSB,Decadakon#1432,11/14/22,pay the TAs more
UCSB,Decadakon#1432,11/14/22,what is the wage for a TA in the UC system
UCSB,Decadakon#1432,11/14/22,THEY'RE STRIKING FOR 30K MORE?
UCSB,Decadakon#1432,11/14/22,"> $54,000 base salary that union leaders say would be fair — and would amount to more than double the workers' average current pay of about $24,000 annually."
UCSB,JockeyAnonðŸŽ„#6643,11/14/22,honestly didnt we give the whole UC system like a two day headstart
UCSB,Pierre#7770,11/14/22,aim high and bargain lower
UCSB,Decadakon#1432,11/14/22,TAs should get paid more
UCSB,JockeyAnonðŸŽ„#6643,11/14/22,"i think they said a 30k increase as a bargain starter, so they can slowly work their way down to a number that sounds more reasonable to both parties and still achieves the main goal, which is realistically only like a 10k increase"
UCSB,Decadakon#1432,11/14/22,tell them to stop striking just so they can fail him?
UCSB,Pierre#7770,11/14/22,who the econ tas bout to tell em to fail him
UCSB,Decadakon#1432,11/14/22,professors would get no research done
UCSB,rareflea#1023,11/14/22,i sit on my ass all day with 43k who's telling me that i should be paid more than a grad student with more experience
UCSB,Decadakon#1432,11/14/22,between Research + TAship + Coursework
UCSB,Museblood#6969,11/14/22,bro said get a real job to people working on grad degrees ðŸ’€
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/14/22,like most grad students dont even take classes but you still have to have tuition waived
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/14/22,I was speaking to one my last quarter and they aren't supposed to be taing a lab more than 20 hrs but the dept gives them 40 hrs of ta work plus the 40 hrs of research they need to do
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/14/22,idk what econ majors do but tas that run labs are paid like shit
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/14/22,Idk what econ tas do tbh
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/14/22,That involves ta work
UCSB,eVoked#7790,11/14/22,some of our classes dont have section so they only there to grade or hold office hours (some classes dont even have office hours with TAs too)
UCSB,eVoked#7790,11/14/22,the ones that do have section hold it once a week to review material/cover new material too
UCSB,Skyco#5004,11/14/22,Econ TAs aren't real
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/14/22,Guess lab tas really get fucked
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/14/22,The uc system just uses its PhD programs as a exploit for cheap labor through its candidates
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/14/22,yeah but grad students doing work for the university arent usually taking classes like that
UCSB,SCB#0078,11/14/22,skyco saw rj talking about the strikes and hopped on
UCSB,Harold Spirit Ambasodor#2268,11/14/22,So how was the Picket line
UCSB,johnic#1983,11/14/22,There was like a strike or something at ucla
UCSB,johnic#1983,11/14/22,Think I might've crossed a picket line today
UCSB,johnic#1983,11/14/22,Not in the union until 6 months tho
UCSB,teelee#9514,11/15/22,do i go to the picket line rn
UCSB,haze#0266,11/15/22,u should say that at the picket line
UCSB,RJ#0601,11/15/22,DOWN WITH THE UNION
UCSB,teelee#9514,11/15/22,guys moose doesnt like unions
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/15/22,i just remembered i was in the last strike pic for cola
UCSB,ðŸŽ…santa baby!#8841,11/15/22,remember when ppl thought covid was planned to stop the cola strikes
UCSB,SCB#0078,11/15/22,you did NOT just sleeper labour solidarity
UCSB,JockeyAnonðŸŽ„#6643,11/16/22,is it just me or did the strike die down a lot since yesterday
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/16/22,but also people from the union are legally obligated to go picket or do remote work so
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/16/22,that happened before the strike
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/16/22,but union is like why wont you just bargain with us
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/16/22,to bargaining
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/16/22,UC wants to add a mediator
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/16/22,No yeah theres been some agreement on points about hiring
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/16/22,the UC contract with 7% intl increase and 3% per year was the offer given to the union like after the strike was voted yes on but before 11/14
UCSB,JockeyAnonðŸŽ„#6643,11/16/22,i hope UAW gets demands soon
UCSB,Î¥Î´Î»#6213,11/16/22,THE STRIKERS ARE PLAYING *NSYNC
UCSB,haze#0266,11/16/22,this strike got me wasting hella time tbh
UCSB,jengatower#0546,11/16/22,Is this one of the strike bashing ppl
UCSB,Î¥Î´Î»#6213,11/17/22,Me telling the history phd grad student to put the sign down and get his bag up
UCSB,JockeyAnonðŸŽ„#6643,11/18/22,it was complaining about the noise level in the lib due to the strike happening right outside the main entrance
UCSB,Rictorinelemons#5075,11/18/22,"btw getting real for a second, for the strike is there anywhere to reliably find updates on the negotiations?"
UCSB,Rictorinelemons#5075,11/18/22,I can't find anything but a bunch of bullshit spam articles saying that the strike is happening
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/18/22,you can attend the bargaining
UCSB,haze#0266,11/18/22,grad students are silly lil guys who fly over the handlebars. theres no incentive to give in
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/18/22,"You're enrolled of 12 units of ""research"" for most of the degree lol"
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/18/22,Yeah but grad students dont really take classes after the first year
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/18/22,depends on the position but the base rate for TAs is 24
UCSB,eurydice#0161,11/18/22,Damn no quizzes cause strike
UCSB,Pierre#7770,11/18/22,we know sp wont be out in the picket lines
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/18/22,"also i get tuition waived for just taing one class and i get paid, not much, but still paid on top of that"
UCSB,Î¥Î´Î»#6213,11/18/22,"""workers rallied on campus and then marched together to UC President Michael Drake's $6.5 million mansion."""
UCSB,rareflea#1023,11/20/22,grad school sounds okay except for the fact that i'll be in school again and i won't have a salary
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/21/22,gainer is making materials for the class now that the tas are striking
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/21/22,BRING BACK THE TAS PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
UCSB,Museblood#6969,11/21/22,rj was kidding about hating the strike...

UCSB,Pierre#7770,11/22/22,no tAs for histo lab..

UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/29/22,guess you dont need when we all know hed ta the class for free just to be ðŸ¤“
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/29/22,zero bargaining power
UCSB,Î¥Î´Î»#6213,11/29/22,with the strike
UCSB,Î¥Î´Î»#6213,11/29/22,"I am not a part of the union because I am legally not a graduate student, post-doc, researcher etc"
UCSB,RJ#0601,11/30/22,this girl didn't strike
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/30/22,i thought you were made that thye were striking...
UCSB,Pierre#7770,11/30/22,dw we'll let her know what u tihnk of the strikes..

UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/3/22,because strike
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/3/22,All the backgrading that will have to get done is going to be insane
UCSB,yoink#0637,12/3/22,/shrug I mean it's just then grading stuff normally but not releasing the grades
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/3/22,I'm pretty sure grading even if it's not released is still a continuation of duties
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/3/22,I know some tas have done that though
UCSB,RJ#0601,12/6/22,If there's ever a scenario that requires a unanimous vote to raise the salary of TAs in the UC system
UCSB,Museblood#6969,12/7/22,say you cancelled lab in solidarity with the striking TAs
UCSB,SCB#0078,12/7/22,sp was the leading the anti strikers wave yesterday...
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/8/22,how about you advertise the strike stuff with an @everyone
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/8/22,UAW has like $800 mil in strike funding
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/8/22,The problem with striking is that you run out of other peoples money....
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/8/22,In strike pay
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/8/22,It sucks our contract at upte means we can't do solidarity strikes
UCSB,haze#0266,12/8/22,nah strikes not in anymore
UCSB,eVoked#7790,12/8/22,This man says something about down with the union
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/9/22,Hunter why are you against the unions strikes
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/9/22,whos grading those ifnals...
UCSB,Museblood#6969,12/9/22,damn so getting rid of TAs gets grades back faster...
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/9/22,Next time u talk to a girl imma come up to you like â€œain't you not support the strikes?â€
UCSB,ðŸŽ…santa baby!#8841,12/9/22,in solidarity
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/11/22,Low key the strikes happening RN is convenient because if I don't get any interviews from UCs I can be like fuck the ucs for underpaying my friends I don't want to go there anyway...
UCSB,haze#0266,12/11/22,yeah they  should never end the strikes
UCSB,Museblood#6969,12/12/22,i'm against the strikes now
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/12/22,solidarity means solidarity with cringe
UCSB,haze#0266,12/13/22,end the strike
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/13/22,ur teacher submitting grades during a strike? Lol .
UCSB,Î¥Î´Î»#6213,12/13/22,the professors grading the work and submitting the grades themselves in no way affects the strike
UCSB,Î¥Î´Î»#6213,12/13/22,It would be a different story if u were a professor supporting the strikes
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/13/22,i was being annpyong but it actually faculty grading stuck work does affect the strike if its normally done by grad students
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/13/22,lecturers union sent a cease and desist to UC for trying to get lecturers to grade what would normally be grad student work
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/13/22,theyre prob just not part of the union
UCSB,yoink#0637,12/13/22,i think the ta's of my cs class are in a diff group or something
UCSB,Museblood#6969,12/14/22,jockey u should make a reddit post asking when grades are going to be posted and if the TAs can take a day off striking just to grade
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/14/22,next time those mfers strike imma take vacation days and learn how to do that shit
UCSB,Pierre#7770,12/15/22,If you got anti union TAs on your team...
UCSB,Pierre#7770,12/17/22,"thats why he's barely here, he's protesting for the tAs"
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/17/22,who tf is mayor steinberg
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/17/22,It might get rejected
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/17/22,uc president is called Michael v Drake what a sick name right
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/17/22,Hell nah bro look at my bargaining team we're not getting good contracts!!
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/17/22,i would reject idk what these ppl thinking
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/17/22,Split between student researchers and instructors
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/17/22,They got pepsi through this new contract
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/17/22,Should reject and strike more at the start of next q imo
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/17/22,Can you make a union within a union
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/17/22,Since grades
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/17/22,Yeah I don't think it makes sense for them to take this contract when the pressure on UC is only going to get worse
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/17/22,"Also this new contract gives higher wages to UCLA, UCB, and UCSF"
UCSB,SCB#0078,12/17/22,cant believe open voted he against the strikes
UCSB,Î¥Î´Î»#6213,12/20/22,me fighting my TA's to post my grade
UCSB,Î¥Î´Î»#6213,12/20/22,ask the TA's
UCSB,haze#0266,12/23/22,i dont do much more with my longer feeling days but when the strike started i kinda just started smoking a lot more regularly
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/23/22,grad stufent contract votes are counted
UCSB,rareflea#1023,12/23/22,didn't the wildcat strikers wanted to vote no
UCSB,Pierre#7770,12/23/22,when all my grades are still nr
UCLA,arnavvr#8596,11/7/22,yo have the profs at ucla communicated with you guys at all about what's going to happen when the grad students go on strike next week
UCLA,yohst#7777,11/7/22,Ain't no way Econ and math TAs give a shit
UCLA,yohst#7777,11/7/22,Unions are monopolies on labor ð
UCLA,SunnyDays#9567,11/7/22,I'm really supporting the TAs by not showing up
UCLA,jas#8080,11/7/22,"psych classes: discussion cancelled this week due to strike :))

stem classes: yeah were underpaid but if you dont come to lab youre gonna fail"
UCLA,Ghoulifer the Great#4620,11/7/22,chem tas should be striking bro they get paid the least in postdocs so like they should be getting the bag whenever possible
UCLA,SunnyDays#9567,11/7/22,Tbh all the Chem TAs I've had were pretty cool
UCLA,Amy-bivalent#4829,11/7/22,i hope my ta strikes he's a great ta

UCLA,jas#8080,11/7/22,my LS TA in freshman year one time told me to talk to someone else when i told him i was having a mental crisis and told me hw was still due that day ð­
UCLA,arnavvr#8596,11/7/22,no because they are striking
UCLA,Styil#2351,11/8/22,imo this is a good example of one problem with unions
UCLA,Styil#2351,11/8/22,even if unions are still better than not having them
UCLA,dalton#1371,11/8/22,we're suspecting a strike is coming soon
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/8/22,ik there's one for TAs but is there a strike for profs cause my stats 20 prof cancelled his lecture today
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/8/22,idk if it was related to any potential strike coming up or smth
UCLA,the_communist_scum#0685,11/8/22,Don't they strike on Thursday
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/8/22,TA strike is next week

UCLA,Mikki#7336,11/10/22,Anyone else got emails from their TAs letting the class know that they're participating in the strike
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/10/22,which TAs arent striking
UCLA,Mikki#7336,11/10/22,How many if you dont mind me asking? I only have one TA letting us know so far
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/10/22,also i heard the TAs are gonna try to block off entrances to some buildings?
UCLA,nuahs#2857,11/11/22,if we want to participate in the strike we dont have to take the second midterm
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/12/22,Strike?
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/12/22,Potentially because of the strike
UCLA,Myx#1957,11/12/22,cuz one of them says TA and the other says no instructors
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/12/22,It's usually p common for them to not find a TA until like a week before the quarter lol
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/12/22,Idk how this strike affects things tho
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/12/22,Strike. One of my TAs gave me a C on the midterm and a C+ on the assignment and now he has no office hours
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/12/22,Also how much do TAs make an hour?
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/12/22,Yeah that's too low. TAs should make much more cause of how much they do
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/12/22,But it sucks when one of your TAs is a rough grader (like marking you off for things that aren't mentioned in the rubric) and then refusing to grade any more assignments
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/12/22,Have any of you guys encountered TAs who are rough graders?
UCLA,enri#2478,11/12/22,It was a history class but it don't matter bc new TAs every quarter
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/12/22,Oh ok. Yeah the rubric for this assignment for one class said to just write 1-2 paragraphs for certain parts and my TA said I should explain things more and mentioned things that the rubric didn't mention.
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/12/22,He seems like a nice guy but I didn't know he'd be a tough grader. I'm new to TAs. I only had one TA at AU before and she did nothing.
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/12/22,"She's my professor, not my TA haha"
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/12/22,@enri she's my PA 10 prof who doesn't grade lower than a C and critiques power dynamics in the classroom
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/12/22,Also is it common for TAs to be harsh graders or no?
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/12/22,My other two TAs have given me As on my assignments
UCLA,Vampyre#9446,11/12/22,That's kinda like asking if its common for any teacher to grade hard
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/12/22,I'm not used to TAs
UCLA,Vampyre#9446,11/12/22,I just see a person that can grade my work
UCLA,Mikki#7336,11/13/22,What about TAs who are unable to nut
UCLA,Mikki#7336,11/13/22,Is holding lectures in place of discussion sections considered crossing the picket line by the professor
UCLA,if and only if#6969,11/14/22,idk what my TA is doing
UCLA,if and only if#6969,11/14/22,my professor's policy is that it's up to whatever they want to do (the TAs)
UCLA,Ghoulifer the Great#4620,11/14/22,one of my TAs is having discussion tomorrow but like I'm not going
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/14/22,Doesn't your grade suffer cause of that?
UCLA,nuahs#2857,11/14/22,one of my tas is not striking
UCLA,Mikki#7336,11/14/22,I have a class with four TAs in it and none of them are striking it seems
UCLA,Muffinlicious#4263,11/14/22,im ngl these strikes are a lifesaver
UCLA,jas#8080,11/14/22,This is like the worst time to graduate dude
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/14/22,I support the strike but I don't support not attending class. I've only skipped class due to not feeling well or a lack of sleep
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/14/22,Are strikers blocking people from going to class?
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/14/22,protests go too hard?
UCLA,if and only if#6969,11/14/22,stem major TA cancelled discussion
UCLA,if and only if#6969,11/14/22,"really? hm, my TA _just_ sent out an email"
UCLA,dalton#1371,11/15/22,are they gonna be striking again tomorrow
UCLA,if and only if#6969,11/15/22,given problems with the professors' contracts
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/15/22,Ok are undergrads getting booed at for crossing the picket line?
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/15/22,I won't disrupt the protesters
UCLA,crew#3333,11/15/22,in most cases you're fine TAs and others protesting are advocating for support and understanding from teachers and undergrads i doubt it would be helping them in any way to boo people
UCLA,dalton#1371,11/15/22,sounds like UC workers made progress in negotiations today
UCLA,if and only if#6969,11/15/22,my spanish prof couldn't cancel class because in the agreement that the lecturers signed in LAST YEARS strike the UC added a clause saying they can't join other strikes
UCLA,dalton#1371,11/15/22,that's where they were having their big pickett line this afternoon
UCLA,kiel#0001,11/15/22,I think the strikers stole an EV
UCLA,if and only if#6969,11/15/22,were undergrads
UCLA,if and only if#6969,11/15/22,we're not crossing the picket line
UCLA,if and only if#6969,11/15/22,_crossing a picket line_ refers to going to work while your fellow employees are striking
UCLA,if and only if#6969,11/15/22,"however, no organization has called for the undergraduate student body to strike"
UCLA,if and only if#6969,11/15/22,but nonetheless there is no picket line for us
UCLA,if and only if#6969,11/15/22,but i think it would be COOL if there was a general strike
UCLA,enri#2478,11/15/22,"if the entire university staff went on strike, itd be over within an hour"
UCLA,crew#3333,11/15/22,UC notesapp apology for paying employees under liveable wage
UCLA,crew#3333,11/15/22,mass email sent out negotiations in less than 24 hours if there was a schoolwide strike
UCLA,enri#2478,11/15/22,"CSUs also have night classes, and its bc CC and CSUs are more geared towards working people while UC student populations are expected to be full time students"
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/16/22,also my class got cancelled again cause of the strike
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/16/22,idt the strike's gonna end by the end of fall so if my prof keeps cancelling cause of the strike ig i have no more lectures?
UCLA,Vampyre#9446,11/16/22,ta strike mmt
UCLA,Mikki#7336,11/16/22,Dalty theyre literally striking due to low wages rn
UCLA,kc#1719,11/19/22,wait unrelated but does anyone else have TAs that didn't strike lmao
UCLA,abrilzies#0412,11/19/22,no but i have a TA that held discussion in secret
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/20/22,How do you guys get to class wit this many people striking?
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/20/22,Ok. Where can I find out where the picket lines are?
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/20/22,Yeah I don't like that. They shouldn't have these massive protests in areas where students need to get food.
UCLA,momo20#5557,11/20/22,"hey guys. sry if this question has been asked already, but are ur TAs who are striking expecting you to submit assignments even tho they won't grade them? what's the general consensus about this?"
UCLA,eggnog#6842,11/20/22,"Varies based on each TA. Generally tho, you wouldn't need to submit assignments if they won't be graded. But I would if I thought my prof was going to take over grading"
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/20/22,I thought profs were going to take over grading
UCLA,Hairy_Beach_Ball#2219,11/22/22,This strike is a week long. You think UCLA gonna upgrade food
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/22/22,get all the TAs to work in dining instead :genius:
UCLA,if and only if#6969,11/22/22,ill go on strike for better food
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/22/22,also ngl i think the strike's gonna go on till winter quarter
UCLA,nuahs#2857,11/22/22,i think we gotta strike for good food
UCLA,yohst#7777,11/22/22,none of my TAs strikes
UCLA,yohst#7777,11/22/22,striked
UCLA,yohst#7777,11/22/22,Econ and Math TAs be like
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/22/22,idk it seems like a lot of stem TAs didnt strike
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/22/22,idt my stats TA striked
UCLA,Hairy_Beach_Ball#2219,11/22/22,none of my TAs striked
UCLA,yohst#7777,11/22/22,Yeah idk why my Econ TAs didn't strike ngl
UCLA,Chris.#0132,11/22/22,yeah my environ e tas striked
UCLA,Elongate#5420,11/22/22,yeah I noticed like all the TAs present for my econ midterm last week lmao
UCLA,yohst#7777,11/22/22,I'm not sure I understand why u wouldn't strike
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/22/22,idk if STEM TAs have it somewhat better than the other TAs
UCLA,Hairy_Beach_Ball#2219,11/22/22,STEM is usually paid research on the side no?
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/22/22,since almost all my STEM TAs are foreign lmao
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/22/22,whereas none of my film TAs are
UCLA,yohst#7777,11/22/22,I did talk to this one TA that said his cell cultures would die and it would take months of work to fix it
UCLA,yohst#7777,11/22/22,So he's not striking
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/22/22,woulnt explain math or econ TAs right
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/22/22,unless they have pertinent research deadlines somehow
UCLA,nuahs#2857,11/22/22,most TAs r still doing research cus they r paid for teaching not research (I think)
UCLA,nuahs#2857,11/22/22,unless they r paid for research in which case why would they be a TA
UCLA,jas#8080,11/22/22,The reason why stem tas arent striking is bc theyre international lul
UCLA,jas#8080,11/22/22,Prof arisaka booted his ta off the entire research project
UCLA,nuahs#2857,11/22/22,my math ls30a TA is the only one not striking
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/22/22,Ta strike?
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/22/22,Ngl if I knew the TA strike was gonna cancel my class tomorrow I woudlve consiered going home tn :genius:
UCLA,niss#3333,11/22/22,have the phys/astro tas been striking mostly
UCLA,Ghoulifer the Great#4620,11/22/22,my stats TA isn't striking but my german and physics one are
UCLA,Chris.#0132,11/22/22,only my enivorn engr TAs are striking
UCLA,enri#2478,11/23/22,I think Is are given in cases where you need to finish assignments for a grade to be given
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/23/22,I thought it's incomplete for now but they can give you a grade after the quarter ends
UCLA,enri#2478,11/23/22,so they can input grades after the quarter ends
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/23/22,The strike could continue after the quarter ends
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/23/22,Will we all have to retake our classes if nothing gets graded
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/24/22,Guys I think my PA 10 prof is giving us A+ grades regardless of work we did or didn't submit.
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/24/22,Its cause of the strike
UCLA,koko#0364,11/25/22,I just wish as a early Christmas present from professors all finals should be canceled cuz of the strike
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/25/22,Seriously- one of my profs is giving us all A+ grades cause of the strike
UCLA,Muffinlicious#4263,11/25/22,maybe id get good grades for once
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/25/22,What are bad grades for you?
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/25/22,Do you guys think an A- is a bad grade
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/25/22,You'd have to have a really easy grader to get an A+
UCLA,enri#2478,11/25/22,A bad grad is a non passing one
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/25/22,but doesnt p/np fall under mandatory grading basis
UCLA,Aspic#0631,11/25/22,mandatorily grade this strike
UCLA,Aspic#0631,11/25/22,what does mandatory grading bassis mean
UCLA,enri#2478,11/25/22,@Olivia see if it'll let you change the grading basis on MyUCLA
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/27/22,"Ok guys question- if my prof says that everyone across the board is getting A+ grades, does that mean I don't have to submit this one essay I got an extension on?"
UCLA,SunnyDays#9567,11/27/22,Actually it seems like most of the engineering TAs aren't striking
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/27/22,I heard STEM TAs in grad housing tend to get their housing covered
UCLA,SunnyDays#9567,11/27/22,I mean I've heard that the math TAs are still striking
UCLA,SunnyDays#9567,11/27/22,Unsure how much better it is for STEM TAs
UCLA,kc#1719,11/27/22,only 1 of my 3 cs classes is not striking
UCLA,Ghoulifer the Great#4620,11/27/22,my only physics class is striking
UCLA,SunnyDays#9567,11/27/22,Only my upper div Chem class is striking
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/27/22,Man is this strike going on till winter
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/27/22,If so I'm p sure all my courses won't have TAs
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/27/22,I feel like profs are going to spend all of winter break grading stuff
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/27/22,When will this strike be over I'm so sick of it
UCLA,nuahs#2857,11/27/22,theres no real resolution that UC can offer without getting more money from taxes
UCLA,SunnyDays#9567,11/27/22,You want finals to be canceled but the strike to be over
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/27/22,I didn't say I'm against the grads. I blame the UC system
UCLA,SunnyDays#9567,11/27/22,Oh yeah for sure the UC system is at fault
UCLA,Amy-bivalent#4829,11/27/22,UC system needs to bargain fairly
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/28/22,TAs often join the groupme and normally they'd be fucked but cause of the strike :genius:
UCLA,Olivia#3251,11/28/22,Did people just check out after the strike?
UCLA,Muffinlicious#4263,11/28/22,the chancellor waking up as protesters storm his mansion
UCLA,crew#3333,11/28/22,are people just staying home since a lot of stuff is online/cancelled bc of the strike?
UCLA,crew#3333,11/28/22,my english teacher says we can do the last paper or take our grade as it is now and not do the final paper - i have a flat B in the class should i just take it bc i expect to have a b whether or not my grade goes up or down anyways
UCLA,tuna#1041,11/28/22,and 50% of my classes dont even have lecture anymore cause of the strike
UCLA,Chris.#0132,11/29/22,the strikers on de hill
UCLA,tuna#1041,12/1/22,They're protesting at 5 am wtf
UCLA,if and only if#6969,12/1/22,no wonder the TAs are striking
UCLA,enri#2478,12/1/22,the UC lawyer watching porn during the bargaining session came up w this campaign to undermine the strikers' efforts
UCLA,Elongate#5420,12/1/22,~~UAW strike~~
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/2/22,The chancellors butthurt at grad students peacefully protesting outside their mansions for living wages
UCLA,enri#2478,12/2/22,the UC lawyer guy being a coomer psychopath makes so much sense when u understand what hes fighting against
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/2/22,Ok honestly this should be enough. 43k plus the money they get from being TAs is 68k a year.
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/2/22,What more do the grads want? This offer looks good
UCLA,nuahs#2857,12/2/22,they reached tentative agreement for 2 groups
UCLA,nuahs#2857,12/2/22,postdoc scholars and academic researchers reached tentative agreements
UCLA,nuahs#2857,12/2/22,academic student employees and graduate student researchers still
UCLA,dalton#1371,12/2/22,"isn't this what they're asking for, not what UC is offering :genius:"
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/2/22,Wait doesn't this say it applies to all grads https://www.fairucnow.org/bargaining-updates/
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/2/22,"Wait I think it says that's the union's proposal, not the UCs. Am I right?"
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/2/22,"That's without their TA income. With their TA income, it's like 68k"
UCLA,enri#2478,12/2/22,olivia they are in the union
UCLA,enri#2478,12/2/22,they are unionized
UCLA,dalton#1371,12/2/22,"yeah that's what they're asking for, not what UC is offering"
UCLA,dalton#1371,12/2/22,although once could say if we paid our TA's more we would be better education wise attracting better professor attracting better students etc etc and increasing our rankings
UCLA,dalton#1371,12/2/22,but because UC is a public school that barely even benefits them
UCLA,nuahs#2857,12/2/22,"idk tbh and idc either, the strike too complicated to have any definitive statements on imo"
UCLA,nuahs#2857,12/2/22,i just hope all my teachers grade adjust me to an A+
UCLA,enri#2478,12/2/22,"that statement was meant to say that this isn't just a UC issue, this is an issue in a majority of the field, so just because $43k is relatively reasonable, that doesn't mean its a sufficient income because the entire field's fucked"
UCLA,nuahs#2857,12/2/22,the uc budget is 43.9 billion
UCLA,niss#3333,12/2/22,think about how many nonsense positions the UC has
UCLA,enri#2478,12/2/22,UC regents can get Newsom and legislature to get more moneys
UCLA,enri#2478,12/2/22,the play could be for the UC to issue bonds for the raises and figure out how to make up the funds later down the road by either getting a budget increase from increased taxes on the populace by the government or a redirecting of state funds towards the UCs
UCLA,dalton#1371,12/2/22,Like I said tho let's say the UAW workers require 60 million dollars to reach their wage gap. That's 60 million ever year. Gotta fund 60 million every year from bonds until we get redirected state funds. And then are we going to get enough state funds to make up that gap? Because with all of the demands that's a probably substantial multibillion dollar annual spending increase. So then which part of the california budget are we getting multiple billions of dollars from?
UCLA,nuahs#2857,12/2/22,whats the mission to starve grad students?
UCLA,nuahs#2857,12/2/22,to take on more grad students than you can afford?
UCLA,dalton#1371,12/2/22,Because UAW would be advertising the plan because it would make UC look fucking stupid if a plan existed to make their asks to be easily acquired and they just weren't doing it cause they didn't want to
UCLA,enri#2478,12/2/22,"california's state government is ideologically opposed to state funding of institutions hence all the budget cuts since reagan, they will not do it unless absolutely pushed which this strike is attempting to do. UAW can't advertise a specific plan because it gives opponents of the strike a chance to attack it using shitty ideologically charged language that can scare people off (the taxes, the budget, socialism?), so the correct move is to make your demands and then it's up to them to solve it instead of presenting some complicated and attackable plan"
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/3/22,Do you guys think profs with 100+ students are actually going to thoroughly go over papers to grade?
UCLA,Farcical Butters#7777,12/3/22,Not reporting the grade
UCLA,dalton#1371,12/3/22,interesting strike update
UCLA,dalton#1371,12/3/22,Graduate students handing out flyers basically begging Postdocs and ARs to not vote yes for their agreeement
UCLA,kc#1719,12/3/22,iirc the agreement is shit
UCLA,dalton#1371,12/3/22,they're calling for undergraduate students to join the strike and fight for tuition decreases and A's for everyone this quarter
UCLA,dalton#1371,12/3/22,the undergraduate flyer?
UCLA,dalton#1371,12/3/22,also calling for higher undergraduate minority enrollment
UCLA,dalton#1371,12/3/22,"not commenting just noting cause it's interesting that both flyers are written in the ""our"" but I don't think they were written by undergrad students lol"
UCLA,tuna#1041,12/4/22,what's the deal with TA striking?
UCLA,Elongate#5420,12/4/22,it was a 2020 strike tactic
UCLA,Dakota#2889,12/4/22,Basically SLAP (and other orgs???) were organizing a protest where people would rush Covel and take food without swiping (not sure why but I THINK it was related to COLA)
UCLA,tuna#1041,12/4/22,yeah what could go wrong when you allow 30k undergrads to storm a dining hall with 1k capacity
UCLA,crew#3333,12/4/22,Brah finals week has been kinda hard knowing i probably wont get my grades back for a while because of grading delays/record withdrawals :holyfuck:
UCLA,crew#3333,12/4/22,My TAs (and im sure others) aren't giving grades for anything they have access to like discussion stuff
UCLA,Vampyre#9446,12/4/22,Ya all my TAs have basically canceled all assignments
UCLA,Vampyre#9446,12/4/22,So all the finals are being graded by the profs
UCLA,crew#3333,12/4/22,But my LS15 class has like a good chunk of grades in the hands of TAs meaning half of my assignments i have no idea what i got so idk what im going into the final w
UCLA,crew#3333,12/4/22,The thing is they're not cancelled as of rn we just have no grades for them - like we had a debate + presentation in our discussion section and our prof has no idea what we got on them
UCLA,Vampyre#9446,12/4/22,Which is what might happen to my essay in one of my classes according to my prof if the TA strike doesn't end
UCLA,crew#3333,12/4/22,I just need a handful more but idk my grade for the ones i took so praying i dont have to retake them
UCLA,tuna#1041,12/5/22,basically undergrads who help out a bit like the TAs
UCLA,dalton#1371,12/5/22,i don't have LA and TA's are on strike
UCLA,tuna#1041,12/5/22,if there's gonna be a TA thats not on strike its gonna be in the math department :genius:
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/5/22,Oh ok. I was wondering cause I'd of my profs calls TAs learning advocates
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/5/22,Interesting. Do STEM TAs make more money?
UCLA,tuna#1041,12/5/22,so if they strike they lose their visa
UCLA,Elongate#5420,12/5/22,econ has like no one on strike afaik
UCLA,Elongate#5420,12/5/22,all my CS TAs are on strike
UCLA,dalton#1371,12/6/22,my math professor said that due to the TA strike hes grading our final using handwriting-reading AI
UCLA,if and only if#6969,12/6/22,and so i go and there's a crowd and apparently some of the strikers set up their hq right outside
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/6/22,"And I support the strike but Geesh my TA was a hard grader and then he was like ""Join me on the picket line!"""
UCLA,dalton#1371,12/7/22,dude the strikes at UCSB have lowkey been disruptive for students
UCLA,tuna#1041,12/7/22,Yeah but this strike in particular was for dining
UCLA,Chris.#0132,12/7/22,strike updatee
UCLA,Hairy_Beach_Ball#2219,12/7/22,"What will be fixed first, this strike or the wi fi issue from week 1"
UCLA,Elongate#5420,12/7/22,Ain't no one got grades yet in this strike
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/8/22,"He's on strike- he's not grading anything. He sent all of us an email before the strike being like ""Join me on the picket line!"" Also my prof knows about my issues so maybe she'll be more understanding but idk"
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/8/22,2 of my professors seem exhausted cause they have no TAs. I can tell by their emails and lack of organization
UCLA,dalton#1371,12/9/22,TA strike and it's xonsequnces
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/9/22,No- I've seen the dog before. Also UCI strikers went out on kayak's to get to a donor
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/9/22,This is a shitshow. Profs are stressed cause their workload just increased by a crap ton. UC must be insanely dumb to not realize what they're doing.
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/9/22,"Well yeah that's why we have TAs and then the strike happened. In a bigger school, you're going to have bigger classes."
UCLA,tuna#1041,12/10/22,maybe thats what the strikes about
UCLA,Muffinlicious#4263,12/13/22,when tf we gettin grades
UCLA,enri#2478,12/13/22,did the strikers come to an agreement?

UCLA,Muffinlicious#4263,12/13/22,normally i wouldnt be worrying this much but the grades for my finals are enough to either pass or fail me so i *am* stressin
UCLA,Hairy_Beach_Ball#2219,12/13/22,Strike resolution is reached btw (I'm wrong)
UCLA,Elongate#5420,12/13/22,it's not over it's just that the postdocs who already reached an agreement are going back to work
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/13/22,Just saw on Twitter that UCs are threatening faculty who cancel classes refuse to grade things
UCLA,Rogue#0710,12/13/22,Inshallah I will not completely fail this contracts final
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/15/22,Ok hopefully the strike will end soon then! 
UCLA,dalton#1371,12/15/22,what did UCSB protesters do?
UCLA,enri#2478,12/15/22,"Yes I know, I'm implying that Dalton is misremembering the post because it's the only protester related post I can remember being made recently"
UCLA,dalton#1371,12/15/22,bruh the other UC strikers went so hard
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/15/22,It looks like the strike will end soon based on the most recent bargaining update
UCLA,tuna#1041,12/17/22,rip those ta salaries
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/17/22,I hope the strike will end then
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/17/22,Yeah their stipend raise combined with their TA income should be like 50k a year
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/17/22,Funny how the grads and I won our fights against bureaucracy at the same time haha
UCLA,drdoofenshmirtz#4330,12/19/22,"just read the email, is the strike over now!"
UCLA,nuahs#2857,12/21/22,do u guys know when grades r gonna come out
UCLA,nuahs#2857,12/21/22,my professors r edging the grades
UCLA,MarkusG#9725,12/21/22,yo do final grades have a due date
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/21/22,I don't know what my grade in Geog 162 is yet. I'm taking it p/np
UCLA,Elongate#5420,12/21/22,mfs haven't even put the final listings on gradescope yet I'm losing my fucking mind
UCLA,Hairy_Beach_Ball#2219,12/21/22,Tfw scantron final still not graded
UCLA,Olivia#3251,12/21/22,Didn't protesters break into a room and destroy a scantron machine?
UCLA,nuahs#2857,12/21/22,how does that help the protest ð­
UCLA,Elongate#5420,12/21/22,I've had at least one scantron final be graded already and the only reason our 131 one is delayed is because carey has to partially grade manually
UCLA,if and only if#6969,12/21/22,my grading finished a few days ago I'm one of the lucky ones
UCLA,Chris.#0132,12/21/22,my grades are half in
