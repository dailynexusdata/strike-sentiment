UCSB,JockeyAnonðŸŽ„#6643,11/11/22,last year when they had the faculty strike
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/11/22,It was an authorized strike but idt it ever became approved
UCSB,Museblood#6969,11/13/22,guys my ochem lab ta is still holding lab... and hes an international student :NWcrying: and katherine just informed me that him not participating in the strike could leave him open to retaliation from ucsb and not getting the protections the unions are bargaining for

UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/13/22,striking but not in solidarity i guess
UCSB,Museblood#6969,11/13/22,FUCK OUR GRADES BE SAFE BIG DAWG
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/13/22,Because he's not protected by the union or the UC for being in between
UCSB,eVoked#7790,11/13/22,i didnt even know there a strike going on
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/13/22,Yeah but we're a day before the strike
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/13/22,Without the strike
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/13/22,So kinda late for bargaining
UCSB,haze#0266,11/13/22,solidarity
UCSB,brandon_#7943,11/13/22,Got the email from two classes about no sections
UCSB,Museblood#6969,11/14/22,they deployed skyco to break the strike
UCSB,Skyco#5004,11/14/22,I be debating the grad students and shit
UCSB,eVoked#7790,11/14/22,Damn maybe if I paid more attention to the strikes I woulda known class was canceled
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/14/22,Strike disrupting
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/14/22,Econ def got Union busting 101
UCSB,RJ#0601,11/14/22,FUCK UNIONS
UCSB,SCB#0078,11/14/22,how tf strikes make your midterm in person LMAOO
UCSB,RJ#0601,11/14/22,But bc all the fuckwad TA's are going on strike there's no one to grade them all
UCSB,JockeyAnonðŸŽ„#6643,11/14/22,honestly even if i was making a comfortable amount of money as a ta(which is improbable) id still go to the strike bc of the workers rights being revoked if you dont participate
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/14/22,*if youre part of the union
UCSB,Decadakon#1432,11/14/22,wasn't it winter 2020 when the TAs last striked
UCSB,JockeyAnonðŸŽ„#6643,11/14/22,like screeching everything to a halt at 2 weeks from finals so everyone complains to the UC and they cave in
UCSB,Decadakon#1432,11/14/22,pay the TAs more
UCSB,Decadakon#1432,11/14/22,what is the wage for a TA in the UC system
UCSB,Decadakon#1432,11/14/22,THEY'RE STRIKING FOR 30K MORE?
UCSB,Decadakon#1432,11/14/22,"> $54,000 base salary that union leaders say would be fair — and would amount to more than double the workers' average current pay of about $24,000 annually."
UCSB,JockeyAnonðŸŽ„#6643,11/14/22,honestly didnt we give the whole UC system like a two day headstart
UCSB,Pierre#7770,11/14/22,aim high and bargain lower
UCSB,Decadakon#1432,11/14/22,TAs should get paid more
UCSB,JockeyAnonðŸŽ„#6643,11/14/22,"i think they said a 30k increase as a bargain starter, so they can slowly work their way down to a number that sounds more reasonable to both parties and still achieves the main goal, which is realistically only like a 10k increase"
UCSB,Decadakon#1432,11/14/22,tell them to stop striking just so they can fail him?
UCSB,Pierre#7770,11/14/22,who the econ tas bout to tell em to fail him
UCSB,Decadakon#1432,11/14/22,professors would get no research done
UCSB,rareflea#1023,11/14/22,i sit on my ass all day with 43k who's telling me that i should be paid more than a grad student with more experience
UCSB,Decadakon#1432,11/14/22,between Research + TAship + Coursework
UCSB,Museblood#6969,11/14/22,bro said get a real job to people working on grad degrees ðŸ’€
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/14/22,like most grad students dont even take classes but you still have to have tuition waived
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/14/22,I was speaking to one my last quarter and they aren't supposed to be taing a lab more than 20 hrs but the dept gives them 40 hrs of ta work plus the 40 hrs of research they need to do
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/14/22,idk what econ majors do but tas that run labs are paid like shit
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/14/22,Idk what econ tas do tbh
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/14/22,That involves ta work
UCSB,eVoked#7790,11/14/22,some of our classes dont have section so they only there to grade or hold office hours (some classes dont even have office hours with TAs too)
UCSB,eVoked#7790,11/14/22,the ones that do have section hold it once a week to review material/cover new material too
UCSB,Skyco#5004,11/14/22,Econ TAs aren't real
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/14/22,Guess lab tas really get fucked
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/14/22,The uc system just uses its PhD programs as a exploit for cheap labor through its candidates
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/14/22,yeah but grad students doing work for the university arent usually taking classes like that
UCSB,SCB#0078,11/14/22,skyco saw rj talking about the strikes and hopped on
UCSB,Harold Spirit Ambasodor#2268,11/14/22,So how was the Picket line
UCSB,johnic#1983,11/14/22,There was like a strike or something at ucla
UCSB,johnic#1983,11/14/22,Think I might've crossed a picket line today
UCSB,johnic#1983,11/14/22,Not in the union until 6 months tho
UCSB,teelee#9514,11/15/22,do i go to the picket line rn
UCSB,haze#0266,11/15/22,u should say that at the picket line
UCSB,RJ#0601,11/15/22,DOWN WITH THE UNION
UCSB,teelee#9514,11/15/22,guys moose doesnt like unions
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/15/22,i just remembered i was in the last strike pic for cola
UCSB,ðŸŽ…santa baby!#8841,11/15/22,remember when ppl thought covid was planned to stop the cola strikes
UCSB,SCB#0078,11/15/22,you did NOT just sleeper labour solidarity
UCSB,JockeyAnonðŸŽ„#6643,11/16/22,is it just me or did the strike die down a lot since yesterday
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/16/22,but also people from the union are legally obligated to go picket or do remote work so
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/16/22,that happened before the strike
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/16/22,but union is like why wont you just bargain with us
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/16/22,to bargaining
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/16/22,UC wants to add a mediator
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/16/22,No yeah theres been some agreement on points about hiring
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/16/22,the UC contract with 7% intl increase and 3% per year was the offer given to the union like after the strike was voted yes on but before 11/14
UCSB,JockeyAnonðŸŽ„#6643,11/16/22,i hope UAW gets demands soon
UCSB,Î¥Î´Î»#6213,11/16/22,THE STRIKERS ARE PLAYING *NSYNC

UCSB,Î¥Î´Î»#6213,11/17/22,Me telling the history phd grad student to put the sign down and get his bag up
UCSB,JockeyAnonðŸŽ„#6643,11/18/22,it was complaining about the noise level in the lib due to the strike happening right outside the main entrance
UCSB,Rictorinelemons#5075,11/18/22,"btw getting real for a second, for the strike is there anywhere to reliably find updates on the negotiations?"
UCSB,Rictorinelemons#5075,11/18/22,I can't find anything but a bunch of bullshit spam articles saying that the strike is happening
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/18/22,you can attend the bargaining
UCSB,haze#0266,11/18/22,grad students are silly lil guys who fly over the handlebars. theres no incentive to give in
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/18/22,"You're enrolled of 12 units of ""research"" for most of the degree lol"
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/18/22,Yeah but grad students dont really take classes after the first year
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/18/22,depends on the position but the base rate for TAs is 24
UCSB,eurydice#0161,11/18/22,Damn no quizzes cause strike
UCSB,Pierre#7770,11/18/22,we know sp wont be out in the picket lines
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/18/22,"also i get tuition waived for just taing one class and i get paid, not much, but still paid on top of that"
UCSB,Î¥Î´Î»#6213,11/18/22,"""workers rallied on campus and then marched together to UC President Michael Drake's $6.5 million mansion."""
UCSB,rareflea#1023,11/20/22,grad school sounds okay except for the fact that i'll be in school again and i won't have a salary
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/21/22,gainer is making materials for the class now that the tas are striking
UCSB,verilcat#2144,11/21/22,BRING BACK THE TAS PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/29/22,zero bargaining power
UCSB,Î¥Î´Î»#6213,11/29/22,with the strike
UCSB,Î¥Î´Î»#6213,11/29/22,"I am not a part of the union because I am legally not a graduate student, post-doc, researcher etc"
UCSB,RJ#0601,11/30/22,this girl didn't strike
UCSB,snailpoop#7012,11/30/22,i thought you were made that thye were striking...

UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/3/22,because strike
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/3/22,All the backgrading that will have to get done is going to be insane
UCSB,yoink#0637,12/3/22,/shrug I mean it's just then grading stuff normally but not releasing the grades
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/3/22,I'm pretty sure grading even if it's not released is still a continuation of duties
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/3/22,I know some tas have done that though
UCSB,RJ#0601,12/6/22,If there's ever a scenario that requires a unanimous vote to raise the salary of TAs in the UC system
UCSB,Museblood#6969,12/7/22,say you cancelled lab in solidarity with the striking TAs
UCSB,SCB#0078,12/7/22,sp was the leading the anti strikers wave yesterday...
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/8/22,how about you advertise the strike stuff with an @everyone
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/8/22,UAW has like $800 mil in strike funding
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/8/22,The problem with striking is that you run out of other peoples money....
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/8/22,In strike pay
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/8/22,It sucks our contract at upte means we can't do solidarity strikes
UCSB,haze#0266,12/8/22,nah strikes not in anymore
UCSB,eVoked#7790,12/8/22,This man says something about down with the union
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/9/22,Hunter why are you against the unions strikes
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/9/22,whos grading those ifnals...
UCSB,Museblood#6969,12/9/22,damn so getting rid of TAs gets grades back faster...
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/9/22,Next time u talk to a girl imma come up to you like â€œain't you not support the strikes?â€
UCSB,ðŸŽ…santa baby!#8841,12/9/22,in solidarity
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/11/22,Low key the strikes happening RN is convenient because if I don't get any interviews from UCs I can be like fuck the ucs for underpaying my friends I don't want to go there anyway...
UCSB,haze#0266,12/11/22,yeah they  should never end the strikes
UCSB,Museblood#6969,12/12/22,i'm against the strikes now
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/12/22,solidarity means solidarity with cringe
UCSB,haze#0266,12/13/22,end the strike
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/13/22,ur teacher submitting grades during a strike? Lol .
UCSB,Î¥Î´Î»#6213,12/13/22,the professors grading the work and submitting the grades themselves in no way affects the strike
UCSB,Î¥Î´Î»#6213,12/13/22,It would be a different story if u were a professor supporting the strikes
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/13/22,i was being annpyong but it actually faculty grading stuck work does affect the strike if its normally done by grad students
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/13/22,lecturers union sent a cease and desist to UC for trying to get lecturers to grade what would normally be grad student work
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/13/22,theyre prob just not part of the union
UCSB,yoink#0637,12/13/22,i think the ta's of my cs class are in a diff group or something
UCSB,Museblood#6969,12/14/22,jockey u should make a reddit post asking when grades are going to be posted and if the TAs can take a day off striking just to grade
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/14/22,next time those mfers strike imma take vacation days and learn how to do that shit
UCSB,Pierre#7770,12/15/22,If you got anti union TAs on your team...
UCSB,Pierre#7770,12/17/22,"thats why he's barely here, he's protesting for the tAs"
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/17/22,who tf is mayor steinberg
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/17/22,It might get rejected
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/17/22,uc president is called Michael v Drake what a sick name right
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/17/22,Hell nah bro look at my bargaining team we're not getting good contracts!!
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/17/22,i would reject idk what these ppl thinking
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/17/22,Split between student researchers and instructors
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/17/22,They got pepsi through this new contract
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/17/22,Should reject and strike more at the start of next q imo
UCSB,johnic#1983,12/17/22,Can you make a union within a union
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/17/22,Since grades
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/17/22,Yeah I don't think it makes sense for them to take this contract when the pressure on UC is only going to get worse
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/17/22,"Also this new contract gives higher wages to UCLA, UCB, and UCSF"
UCSB,SCB#0078,12/17/22,cant believe open voted he against the strikes
UCSB,Î¥Î´Î»#6213,12/20/22,me fighting my TA's to post my grade
UCSB,Î¥Î´Î»#6213,12/20/22,ask the TA's
UCSB,haze#0266,12/23/22,i dont do much more with my longer feeling days but when the strike started i kinda just started smoking a lot more regularly
UCSB,verilcat#2144,12/23/22,grad stufent contract votes are counted
UCSB,rareflea#1023,12/23/22,didn't the wildcat strikers wanted to vote no
UCSB,Pierre#7770,12/23/22,when all my grades are still nr
